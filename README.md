My pet project application to make content quality assurance easier. This tool is not meant for general usage.

## Disclaimer:

There's a lot here that is probably bad/tech debt and with any luck some good parts. 

The entire development process was a learning experience. There are sections of this that I would redo if I rebuilt this. There are other parts that were so bad that I did try to clean it up. In short, the entire thing is a bit of an enigma.

What's important though is that it completed it's job and saved countless hours of work.
